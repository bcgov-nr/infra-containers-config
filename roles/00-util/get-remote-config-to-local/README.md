**Apache Create HTTPD Config Backup on Server**

**Description:**

This role is for getting tarball dumps of current Apache httpd instance configs from remote servers.

The dumps can be compared with local workstation and repo files when troubleshooting or for periodic cleanup
since the httpd config pushes may not remove files that are deleted from the repo.
